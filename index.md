The **visual arts** are art forms such as:

- Painting
- Drawing
- Printmaking
- Sculpture
- Ceramics
- Photography
- Video
- Filmmaking
- Design
- Crafts
- Architecture

Many artistic disciplines such as performing arts, conceptual art, and textile arts *also involve aspects of visual arts* as well as arts of other types.
  
Also included within the visual arts are the applied arts such as:
  
- Industrial design
- Graphic design
- Fashion design
- Interior design
- Decorative art

Current usage of the term **"visual arts"** includes fine art as well as the applied or decorative arts and crafts, but this was not always the case. Before the Arts and Crafts Movement in Britain and elsewhere at the turn of the 20th century, the term 'artist' had for some centuries often been restricted to a person working in the fine arts (such as painting, sculpture, or printmaking) and not the decorative arts, craft, or applied Visual arts media.
  
The distinction was emphasized by artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement, who valued vernacular art forms as much as high forms. Art schools made a distinction between the fine arts and the crafts, maintaining that a craftsperson could not be considered a practitioner of the arts.
  
The **Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan**. Museums constitute a primary forum for the display of visual arts.

The increasing tendency to privilege painting, and to a lesser degree sculpture, above other arts has been a feature of Western art as well as East Asian art.
  
In both regions painting has been seen as relying to the highest degree on the imagination of the artist, and the furthest removed from manual labour â€“ in Chinese painting the most highly valued styles were those of "scholar-painting", at least in theory practiced by gentleman amateurs. The Western hierarchy of genres reflected similar attitudes.

## Education and training

Training in the visual arts has generally been through variations of the apprentice and workshop systems. In Europe the Renaissance movement to increase the prestige of the artist led to the academy system for training artists, and today most of the people who are pursuing a career in arts train in art schools at tertiary levels. Visual arts have now become an elective subject in most education systems.

## Drawing

Drawing is a means of making an image, illustration or graphic using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques available online and offline. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface using dry media such as:

- Graphite pencils
- Pen and ink
- Inked brushes
- Wax color pencils
- Crayons
- Charcoals
- Pastels
- Markers

Digital tools, including pens, stylus, Apple pencilthat simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: 

- Line drawing
- Hatching
- Crosshatching
- Random hatching
- Scribbling
- Stippling
- Blending

An artist who excels in drawing is referred to as a draftsman or draughtsman.

## Painting

Painting taken literally is the practice of applying pigment suspended in a carrier (or medium) and a binding agent (a glue) to a surface (support) such as paper, canvas or a wall. However, when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with drawing, composition, or other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner.

Painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas; sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to The Sistine Chapel to the human body itself.
